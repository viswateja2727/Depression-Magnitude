## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans tweets using tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Model Training:** Implements both LSTM and BERT architectures for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation:** Measures model performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- **Modular Code:** Well-structured and easy to extend.
